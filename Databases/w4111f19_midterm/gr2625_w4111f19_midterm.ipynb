    "<b>Cartesian product</b>, denoted as: $A \\times B$. It construct the result out of each possible ordered pairs of tuples from the two tables. (if table A has n rows, B has m rows, the result cartesian product of two tables contain $m \\times n$ rows)\\\n",
    "<b>Equijoin</b> correspond to the SQL queries of the format: \"SELECT * FROM table1 JOIN table2 ON condition\", or it can be denoted as $ \\sigma_{condition}(table1 \\times table2) $ (condition has the form a=b, c=d,...). The result is constructed by combining rows from two tables that have equivalent values for the specified columns (rows don't share equivalent values are discarded by default). If two tables contains the columns with same names, they are renamed and repeated in the result table.\\\n",
    "<b>Natural join</b> correspond to the SQL queries of the format: \"SELECT * FROM table1 NATURAL JOIN table2\". Natural join is like equijoin that works on the columns with the same name between two tables. It works by returning rows with the equivalent values for identically named columns between two tables. But repeated columns with the same name will appear once only.\\\n",
